## Description 
The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js back end to retrieve note data from JSON file. Our main tasks were to ensure that:
- When opening the Note Taker, the user is presented with a landing page with links to a note page.
- When the user clicks the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
-When the suer clicks on the Save icon, then the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
- When an existing note in the list in the left-hand column is clicked, then that note appears in the right hand column.
- When the suer clicks the write icon in the navigation bar at the top of the page, then they are presented with empty field to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
